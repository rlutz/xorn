=============

- Object data is now validated and invalid data rejected

- Object data is normalized after copying; any stored object data is
  guaranteed to be in a standard format

- xorn_delete_object and xorn_delete_selected_objects now return 0 on
  success and -1 on failure (no objects matching the specified
  selection being considered success)

- Object manipulation functions now have an additional parameter `err'
  returning the error code

    xorn_object_is_selected

    xorn_select_including
